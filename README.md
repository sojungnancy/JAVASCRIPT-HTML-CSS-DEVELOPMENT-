This repository contains the frontend implementation for the NZSL Web Application, integrating the **C# APIs** developed in previous assignments. It is a **service-oriented architecture (SOA) project** that provides an interactive platform for learning **New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL)**.

## üìù Assignments Overview
This repository contains assignments focused on frontend development using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The assignments integrate C# APIs to build a fully functional client-side application.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 3: Initial Frontend Implementation
- Developed a basic **client-side** interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**
- Implemented **responsive UI components** for improved accessibility.
- Ensured clean code structure following best practices.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 4: SVG & Enhanced UI
- Designed an **SVG-based logo** without using <path>, ensuring better readability.
- Developed interactive UI elements using **JavaScript.**
- Focused on scalability and cross-browser compatibility.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 5: XML Schema & API Integration
- Focuses on **XML Schema Definition (XSD)** to validate chess moves in an XML format.
- Design and validate structured data formats, which is essential for** software interoperability and data integrity.**

Each assignment builds upon the previous one, refining the client-side application with structured enhancements. üöÄ
